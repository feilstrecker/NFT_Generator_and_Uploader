⇾ Hi, I'm Leonardo, I'm 16 years old and I'm from Brazil.
⇾ I maked this code to nft makers don't lose time making NFTS one per one or having manual upload.

How use:
------------------------------------
1 option: nft generator

On this option, you can generate the nfts with the images
(All images need be png)
Before, you need save the images in this type:
Item_Name-Item_Color
for example:
I have a background blue
Background-Blue
I have an Old suit black and white
Old_suit-Black_and_White
(It will help the upload on properties more later)
------------------------------------
2 option: nft uploader

You need type the nft name and nft description
after, automatically the chrome will open, make login into opensea and type the collection name.
so, the code will make a auto upload putting "nft_name nft_number", nft description, and it properties.

(your library need to be into path "done" when the code open it)
------------------------------------
3 option: nft rarity

You need type the item name and it color
so, the code will show to you how many nfts have with that item and how many you want remove.
after your choice, the code will remove that amount of nfts with that item.
and so, the rarity of that item will increase.
------------------------------------
4 option: show nfts and its rarities
------------------------------------
(You need have Python3 installed to run this)
